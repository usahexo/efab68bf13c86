He has been the president since joint ownership of the club was transferred to him and his son, David Sullivan Jr., in 2010.</p>
<h1 id="What-does-the-club’s-crest-depict"><a href="#What-does-the-club’s-crest-depict" class="headerlink" title="What does the club’s crest depict?"></a>What does the club’s crest depict?</h1><p>The club’s crest is a variation of the Borough’s coat of arms. The shield is quartered and displays the following: the first and fourth quarters feature a cross bottony; the second quarter has three stags’ heads (representing Edward III); and the third quarter has a sheaf of wheat (representing the local farming industry). The crest also features a garland of roses around the top and the Latin motto “Audentes Fortuna Juvat” which translates to “Fortune Favours The Bold.”</p>

They defeated Bishop Auckland 2-1 in the final, with goals from Jack Reynolds and George Webb. In more recent times, they reached the final of the FA Vase in both 1992 and 2002, but narrowly missed out on becoming champions on both occasions, losing to Tipton Town and Bedworth United respectively.</p>
<h1 id="Which-manager-led-the-club-to-their-last-major-trophy-victory"><a href="#Which-manager-led-the-club-to-their-last-major-trophy-victory" class="headerlink" title="Which manager led the club to their last major trophy victory?"></a>Which manager led the club to their last major trophy victory?</h1><p>It’s a question that has been asked for years amongst Liverpool fans – who is the best manager to lead the club to a major trophy victory?</p>
<p>Some may say that it’s Bob Paisley, who led the club to three European Cup victories in the 1970s. Others may say that it’s Rafael Benitez, who won the Champions League in 2005. Or perhaps it’s Kenny Dalglish, who won the League Cup and FA Cup double in 2011.</p>
<p>But the answer to this question is not so clear-cut. In fact, some would argue that Jurgen Klopp is the best manager to lead Liverpool to a major trophy victory. After all, he did lead them to the Champions League final in 2018.</p>
<p>However, others would say that Klopp has not yet delivered on his promise at Liverpool and that he has yet to win a major trophy with the club. So, it remains to be seen who is truly the best manager to lead Liverpool to a major trophy victory.</p>

<p>In their first season in the Premier League, they finished 10th. The next season, they finished 7th and qualified for the UEFA Cup. West Ham reached the final of the competition in 1999 but lost to Spanish side Valencia.</p>
<p>The club was relegated from the Premier League in 2001 but gained promotion back at the first attempt. They were relegated again in 2003 but bounced back up once more.</p>
<p>West Ham then had their longest spell in the top flight, spending five consecutive seasons in the Premier League between 2005-2010. They were relegated at the end of the 2010-11 season but gained promotion back as Champions of the Football League Championship a year later.</p>
<p>The club was relegated for a third time at the end of the 2014-15 season, finishing in 18th place. They were promoted as runners-up in the 2017-18 season, behind champions Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-the-club’s-all-time-leading-goalscorer"><a href="#Who-is-the-club’s-all-time-leading-goalscorer" class="headerlink" title="Who is the club’s all-time leading goalscorer?"></a>Who is the club’s all-time leading goalscorer?</h1><p>The Liverpool F.C. is an English professional association football club based in Liverpool, Merseyside. The club was formed in 1892 as Everton F.C. Liverpool are one of the most successful clubs in England and have won more European trophies than any other English team with five European Cups, three UEFA Cups, three UEFA Super Cups and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.</p>
<p>Liverpool’s all-time top goalscorer is Ian Rush, who scored 346 goals in his 12 years at the club. Rush also holds the record for most goals scored in a season, with 47 in 1983–84. Bobby Charlton is second on the list with 249 goals and Roger Hunt is third with 220 Goals.</p>
