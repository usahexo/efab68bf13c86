<p>Mauricio Pochettino said his Tottenham Hotspur side had achieved a moral victory in their Champions League last-16 first leg against holders Real Madrid on Tuesday despite the 1-1 draw. </p>
<p>Kieran Trippier’s fine free kick gave Spurs the lead against the run of play at Wembley before Cristiano Ronaldo equalized with a superb header shortly after halftime.</p>
<p>Spurs dug deep to keep Real at bay as they laid siege to the home goal in the second period, although the English side will rue missing a host of chances to extend their lead.</p>
<p>“To compete against Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern (Munich), Juventus is so difficult,” Pochettino told reporters. “I think we can feel very proud of our players and how they performed tonight. I think it was a great game for us and for football.” </p>
<p>Tottenham have now lost just one of their last 16 home games in Europe and remain unbeaten in this season’s competition, giving themselves a good chance of reaching the quarter-finals for the first time since 2011. </p>
<p>“We are so happy in the way we played and competed,” Pochettino added.”I think we deserved more than a draw. This type of game will help us to improve and learn.” </p>
<p>It was always going to be tough test for Tottenham going up against 12 times European champions Real Madrid but they more than put up a fight. Kieran Trippier’s sublime freekick in the first half gave Spurs fans something to cheer about early on and they continued to battle well in the second half despite being under pressure for large periods. Dele Alli could have given them an even better result late on but hit the post after some good build up play from Spurs. There were some heroic performances throughout the team but Hugo Lloris was outstanding when called upon making some crucial saves – including one fantastic double save in injury time – meaning Mauricio Pochettino’s men earn themselves what could be a vital away goal ahead of next month’s return leg at the Bernabeu.</p>
<h1 id="Mauricio-Pochettino-We-Gave-Our-Best-But-It-Wasn’t-Enough"><a href="#Mauricio-Pochettino-We-Gave-Our-Best-But-It-Wasn’t-Enough" class="headerlink" title="Mauricio Pochettino: We Gave Our Best But It Wasn’t Enough"></a>Mauricio Pochettino: We Gave Our Best But It Wasn’t Enough</h1><p>Mauricio Pochettino said Tottenham Hotspur “gave our best” but were knocked out of the Champions League by Juventus after a 2-1 defeat on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Spurs, playing at their temporary Wembley home, went down to two goals in the first half from Gonzalo Higuain and Dybala.</p>
<p>Christian Eriksen got one back for Tottenham in the second half but it was not enough to take them through to the last eight.</p>
<p>“I’m so disappointed,” Spurs boss Pochettino said. “We gave our best but it wasn’t enough. You can see in both games that we competed well and deserved to go through.”</p>
<p>Pochettino felt his side were unlucky with the two goals they conceded.</p>
<p>“The first goal was offside and the second one was a clear handball,” he said. “But that’s football. I’m proud of my players because they showed great character.”</p>
<h1 id="Tottenham-Hotspur-Can-Take-Some-Pride-From-Coming-Close-Against-Real-Madrid"><a href="#Tottenham-Hotspur-Can-Take-Some-Pride-From-Coming-Close-Against-Real-Madrid" class="headerlink" title="Tottenham Hotspur Can Take Some Pride From Coming Close Against Real Madrid"></a>Tottenham Hotspur Can Take Some Pride From Coming Close Against Real Madrid</h1><p>Although Tottenham Hotspur ultimately lost the Champions League clash against Real Madrid, they can take some pride from their performance in the game, which saw them push the Spanish giants all the way.</p>
<p>Tottenham had to come from behind twice in the game, with Cristiano Ronaldo netting twice for Madrid, but Harry Kane and Dele Alli both found the back of the net to ensure that Spurs went into the break on level terms.</p>
<p>The second half was a more even affair, with Madrid having just a little bit more of the ball, but Tottenham defended stoutly and looked dangerous on the break. However, with just seven minutes remaining, Gareth Bale – who left Spurs for Madrid in 2013 – scored what turned out to be the winner.</p>
<p>Although they ultimately lost, this was still an excellent performance from Tottenham and one which will give them confidence for their remaining fixtures in this year’s competition. They will now look to replicate this form in their Premier League campaign as they bid to finish in the top four once again.</p>
<h1 id="Dele-Alli-Tottenham-Will-Keep-Fighting-In-The-Future"><a href="#Dele-Alli-Tottenham-Will-Keep-Fighting-In-The-Future" class="headerlink" title="Dele Alli: Tottenham Will Keep Fighting In The Future"></a>Dele Alli: Tottenham Will Keep Fighting In The Future</h1><p>Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Dele Alli has stated that the side will fight for their future, despite slipping to a 2-1 home defeat to Chelsea on Sunday. </p>
<p>A goal from Marcos Alonso in the first half and another from Eden Hazard late on gave Chelsea the victory, but Alli was defiant after the match and believes that the team can still salvage something from the season. </p>
<p>“We’ll keep fighting in the future,” he said. “There’s still a lot to play for this season.” </p>
<p>Spurs now sit in fifth place in the Premier League table, four points behind fourth-placed Liverpool with nine games remaining. They also have to contend with Chelsea in cup competitions, as they face each other in this season’s FA Cup semi-final. </p>
<p>Alli himself has had a difficult season, scoring only six goals in all competitions - his lowest tally since joining Tottenham - and he was substituted against Chelsea after 58 minutes. Mauricio Pochettino later revealed that he had been suffering from a bout of flu. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Alli is determined to help Tottenham finish as strongly as possible. “It’s not been our best season but we’ve got to try and finish as strong as we can,” he said. “The fans were amazing today and we really appreciate it.”</p>
<h1 id="Tottenham-Hotspur-Left-To-Rue-Chances-Missed-In-Clash-With-Real-Madrid"><a href="#Tottenham-Hotspur-Left-To-Rue-Chances-Missed-In-Clash-With-Real-Madrid" class="headerlink" title="Tottenham Hotspur Left To Rue Chances Missed In Clash With Real Madrid"></a>Tottenham Hotspur Left To Rue Chances Missed In Clash With Real Madrid</h1><p>A below-par performance from Tottenham Hotspur saw them crash out of the Champions League in disappointing fashion against reigning champions Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema either side of a Hugo Lloris save to deny Gareth Bale gave Los Blancos a 3-1 victory on the night, and a 4-2 aggregate win.</p>
<p>Spurs had chances to get back into the game, but they will be left to regret not making the most of them as they failed to create a clear opening after Ronaldo’s opener.</p>
<p>“The feeling is terrible,” said Spurs defender Jan Vertonghen. “We gave everything, but in the end it wasn’t enough. We played very well in the first leg but here we didn’t play well enough.”</p>
<p>Mauricio Pochettino’s men were disappointing throughout and were second best for long periods against Zinedine Zidane’s side.</p>
<p>They will now have to focus on their fight for Champions League qualification in the Premier League, where they currently sit in fourth place, four points off leaders Chelsea.</p>
