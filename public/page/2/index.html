        <h1 id="Professional-athletes-urge-fans-to-avoid-gambling"><a href="#Professional-athletes-urge-fans-to-avoid-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Professional athletes urge fans to avoid gambling"></a>Professional athletes urge fans to avoid gambling</h1><p>A number of professional athletes are urging their fans to avoid gambling, saying that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin.</p>
<p>In a video campaign dubbed “Don’t Bet on It,” NBA stars Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and James Harden warn about the dangers of gambling.</p>
<p>“Gambling can be very addictive and can take over your life pretty quickly,” Curry says in the video. “It can cause financial problems, legal problems, and worst of all, it can cost you relationships with the people you care about most.”</p>
<p>Harden adds, “Gambling definitely is not worth it. It’s nothing but headaches and heartaches.”</p>
<p>The campaign is funded by the American Gaming Association, which represents the casino industry. The association has been fighting efforts to expand legalized sports betting beyond Nevada.</p>
<p>Professional athletes have long been wary of gambling, dating back to the Black Sox Scandal of 1919 in which several members of the Chicago White Sox were accused of throwing the World Series after taking bribes from gamblers.</p>
<h1 id="Athletes-warn-of-the-dangers-of-gambling"><a href="#Athletes-warn-of-the-dangers-of-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Athletes warn of the dangers of gambling"></a>Athletes warn of the dangers of gambling</h1><p>In the world of professional sports, gambling is often spoken about in hushed tones. Athletes and team owners routinely admonish their players against placing any type of bet on sporting events, arguing that it is a surefire way to ruin careers.</p>
<p>While there are certainly dangers associated with gambling, many athletes argue that it can also be a source of excitement and entertainment. They maintain that as long as bets are placed responsibly and players don’t allow themselves to be drawn into unhealthy betting habits, gambling can be an enjoyable diversion.</p>
<p>Despite these arguments, most professional sports leagues take a dim view of gambling and do everything they can to discourage players from engaging in it. This is due in part to the fact that there have been a number of high-profile cases in which athletes have lost large sums of money as a result of their gambling activities.</p>
<p>One such case involved former NBA player Michael Jordan, who reportedly lost millions of dollars by betting on basketball games. In addition, several current and former NFL players have been suspended from the league for violating its gambling policy.</p>
<p>Clearly, gambling can be harmful if not done correctly. However, with responsible betting and adherence to league rules, there is no reason why it can’t be a fun activity for athletes and fans alike.</p>
<h1 id="Pro-athletes-want-fans-to-steer-clear-of-gambling"><a href="#Pro-athletes-want-fans-to-steer-clear-of-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pro athletes want fans to steer clear of gambling"></a>Pro athletes want fans to steer clear of gambling</h1><p>One might think that professional athletes would be all for anything that fans do to support their team, but apparently, some pros are asking people to steer clear of gambling when it comes to sports.</p>
<p>Athletes like LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant have spoken out recently about the dangers of gambling and how it can negatively affect not just the game, but also the players themselves.</p>
<p>Durant was especially vocal on the issue, saying that he doesn’t want fans to “gamble on our games.”</p>
<p>“It’s such a touchy topic because it is entertainment, but we don’t want anyone affecting the game in a negative way because they’re betting on it and things like that,” said Durant.</p>
<p>James echoed Durant’s sentiment, noting that while he understands that gambling is a part of sports fandom for some people, it can still be harmful.</p>
<p>In fact, research has shown that a significant number of people who gamble on sports do so in order to make money – something that can have a very dangerous impact on the games themselves.</p>
<p>Curry pointed out that there are already enough ways for people to make money through sports without having to bet on them, and he doesn’t want fans to put their hard-earned money at risk by gambling on games.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it seems as though professional athletes just want their fans to enjoy the games in a safe and responsible way – and that definitely doesn’t include gambling on them.</p>
<h1 id="Players-urge-fans-not-to-gamble-on-sports"><a href="#Players-urge-fans-not-to-gamble-on-sports" class="headerlink" title="Players urge fans not to gamble on sports"></a>Players urge fans not to gamble on sports</h1><p>As the excitement of the World Cup builds, players are urging fans not to gamble on the games.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference in Moscow, several players said that betting can ruin careers and friendships.</p>
<p>“We want to urge all fans not to bet on the World Cup,” German midfielder Toni Kroos said. “It can ruin lives and careers. It’s not worth it.”</p>
<p>Kroos was joined by Brazilian defender Thiago Silva, who said, “Gambling can cause huge problems – it can even lead to divorce. So please don’t do it!”</p>
<p>In England, midfielder Dele Alli echoed those sentiments. “Don’t bet on the World Cup – it can ruin your life. I’ve seen it happen to people close to me and it’s not nice. So don’t do it!”</p>
<p>Alli is no stranger to gambling controversies himself; he was fined £25,000 by The Football Association in February for appearing in an advertising campaign for a bookmaker last year.</p>
<p>Players have good reason to be concerned about the dangers of gambling: In March, FIFA imposed a six-year ban on Slovenian player Andraz Struna for gambling on his own national team matches. In addition, former England international Paul Gascoigne has been blighted by gambling problems throughout his career.</p>
<p>So far during the World Cup, there have been no reports of any players being banned for gambling on the tournament; however, with billions of dollars at stake, there is plenty of potential for corruption.</p>
<p>While some countries have introduced laws banning gambling on sports events, many fans continue to bet illegally. According to a study by UK-based Betting Watchdog last year, 97% of people in Britain who gamble on sport do so illegally.</p>
<p>With so much money at stake, it is unlikely that fans will stop betting on this year’s World Cup anytime soon. However, players would prefer that fans don’t put their financial future or personal relationships at risk by wagering on the games.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-figures-speak-out-against-gambling"><a href="#Sports-figures-speak-out-against-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Sports figures speak out against gambling"></a>Sports figures speak out against gambling</h1><p>In the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision to repeal the federal ban on sports betting, many professional athletes have spoken out against gambling.</p>
<p>NFL quarterback Cam Newton said, “I think it’s bad for our society. Gambling is based on greed. It’s not good for people in our society.”</p>
<p>NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley added, “I love gambling, but I hate gaming. There’s a big difference. Gambling is when you go to casinos and stuff like that. Gaming is when you sit in your house and play video games all day long… I think it’s a terrible idea. I don’t think people should be able to gamble on sports… I just don’t think it’s a good thing for our country.”</p>
<p>Gambling has long been a controversial issue, with many arguing that it can have negative consequences for both individuals and society as a whole. Professional athletes have often been some of the most vocal opponents of gambling, and their voices are likely to be amplified in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision.</p>

        <h1 id="D2-Lod-Gambling-What-You-Can-and-Cannot-Gamble"><a href="#D2-Lod-Gambling-What-You-Can-and-Cannot-Gamble" class="headerlink" title="D2 Lod Gambling - What You Can and Cannot Gamble"></a>D2 Lod Gambling - What You Can and Cannot Gamble</h1><p>Lod gambling is a form of gambling that is specific to the video game Diablo II. It can only be done with in-game currency, which is gold and silver. There are many different things that can be gambled, but the most common things are weapons, armor, runes, and charms.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember when gambling is that there is no way to get your money back if you lose. This means that it’s important to know what you’re doing before you start spending your hard-earned gold on bets. The best way to learn is by watching other people gamble or by practicing on cheaper items first.</p>
<p>There are a few things that you cannot gamble in Lod: items that are not meant for your character class, uniques, items with sockets, gemwords, and runewords. You also cannot gamble sets or quest items.</p>
<p>The basic rules of gambling are very simple. To gamble an item, drag it onto the betting table. Next, choose how much you want to bet by clicking on one of the gold or silver coins on the table. Once you’ve chosen how much you want to bet, click on the “Roll” button to see the result of the roll. If you win, your item will double in value and will be added to your inventory automatically. If you lose, your item will be destroyed and you will not receive any compensation.</p>
<p>There are a few different types of bets that can be made in Lod gambling: straight up bet, double up bet, or side bet. A straight up bet is when you bet on a single number without any modifiers. A double up bet is when you risk your current item in order to try and win two items of equal value. A side bet is when you wager part of your inventory against another player’s inventory in order for one player to win all the items at once.</p>
<h1 id="D2-Lod-Gambling-What-is-and-is-not-allowed"><a href="#D2-Lod-Gambling-What-is-and-is-not-allowed" class="headerlink" title="D2 Lod Gambling: What is and is not allowed"></a>D2 Lod Gambling: What is and is not allowed</h1><p>D2 Lod Gambling is a popular pastime in the game, and many people engage in it. However, there are some things you should know about D2 Lod gambling before you start.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is what is allowed and what is not. In general, you are allowed to gamble on practically anything in the game that has an element of chance involved. This includes items, skills, stats, and more. You can also gamble on the outcome of duels and other PvP matches.</p>
<p>There are a few things that are off limits, however. You cannot gamble on the outcome of any PvE content, including boss fights, farming runs, and so on. You also cannot gamble on items that you plan to use in such content. For example, if you are trying to roll a specific item for a raid boss fight, you cannot gamble on it.</p>
<p>Another important thing to keep in mind when gambling is that there is always the potential for fraud. There have been cases where people have taken advantage of others by rigging gambling matches or by falsely claiming that they have won something. It is important to be aware of these risks and to only gamble with people you trust.</p>
<p>If you want to start gambling in D2 Lod, there are a few things you need to do first. The first is to find someone who is willing to gamble with you. Second is to come up with an agreement about what can and cannot be gambled on. Finally, both parties need to agree on the stakes of the match.</p>
<p>Once all of that is done, it’s time to get started! Just remember to have fun and be safe while gambling in D2 Lod</p>
<h1 id="D2-Lod-Gambling-What-can-and-can’t-be-gambled"><a href="#D2-Lod-Gambling-What-can-and-can’t-be-gambled" class="headerlink" title="D2 Lod Gambling: What can and can’t be gambled"></a>D2 Lod Gambling: What can and can’t be gambled</h1><p>The world of gambling is one that is filled with mystery, intrigue and excitement. From the simple game of flipping a coin, to betting on the outcome of a horse race, to playing the stock market- there is something for everyone when it comes to gambling. However, there are some things that can be gambled on, and some things that cannot. In this article we will explore what can and cannot be gambled on in D2 Lod.</p>
<p>One thing that can be gambled on in D2 Lod is items. This includes both weapons and armor. When gambling an item, you are essentially putting it up for auction, and other players can bid on it. The highest bidder wins the item, and the player who put it up for auction receives whatever money was bid on it. There are a few things to keep in mind when gambling items:  first, you cannot gamble an item if it is your only one; second, you cannot gamble an item if it is currently equipped; third, you cannot gamble an item that is bound to you.</p>
<p>Another thing that can be gambled in D2 Lod is gold. Gold can be used to purchase items from other players in the game, as well as to gamble with. When gambling gold, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, the amount of gold being gambled must be equivalent to or less than the player’s current stash size; second, when gambling gold you are essentially putting it up for auction, and other players can bid on it just like they would with an item; third, there are no restrictions on who can bid on gold- even people who are not in your game can bid on it.</p>
<p>There are also some things that cannot be gambled in D2 Lod. Chief among these is XP (experience points). XP cannot be gambled because it is essential for character advancement. Characters need XP in order to level up and progress through the game. Another thing that cannot be gambled is Gems- these are used to purchase premium features in the game such as inventory slots and character slots. Lastly, equipment that has beensocketed with gems cannot be gambled either.</p>
<h1 id="Lessons-on-D2-Lod-Gambling-What-can-and-cannot-be-gambled"><a href="#Lessons-on-D2-Lod-Gambling-What-can-and-cannot-be-gambled" class="headerlink" title="Lessons on D2 Lod Gambling: What can and cannot be gambled"></a>Lessons on D2 Lod Gambling: What can and cannot be gambled</h1><p>D2 lod gambling is a great way to pass the time and make some extra gold. However, before you start gambling you should be aware of what can and cannot be gambled. In this article we will go over the basics of D2 lod gambling and what you can do to get the most out of your gambling experience.</p>
<h1 id="The-Basics"><a href="#The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="The Basics"></a>The Basics</h1><p>In D2 lod there are a few different things that can be gambled: weapon racks, armor racks, chests, and keys. Weapons racks contain rare weapons that can only be found in lod. Armor racks contain rares as well as sets and uniques. Chests contain sets, uniques, cube recipes, and other rares. Keys are used to open locked chests.</p>
<p>The key thing to remember when gambling is that the odds of winning depend on the rarity of the item. The rarer the item, the less likely it is to win. This means that if you are looking to gamble for a specific item, it is best to gamble for something that is not too rare. For example, if you are looking for an amulet of wisdom you would be better off gambling for an armor rack rather than a weapon rack.</p>
<h1 id="What-Can-Be-Gambled"><a href="#What-Can-Be-Gambled" class="headerlink" title="What Can Be Gambled?"></a>What Can Be Gambled?</h1><p>Weapon racks: These contain rare weapons that can only be found in lod. The weapons in these racks have a higher chance of being magical or socketed than those in other types of racks. There is also a small chance of getting a unique or set weapon from these racks.</p>
<p>Armor racks: These contain rares as well as sets and uniques. The rares in these racks have a higher chance of being magical or socketed than those in other types of chests. There is also a small chance of getting a unique or set piece from these chests.</p>
<p>  Keys: Keys are used to open locked chests. There is a small chance of getting a unique or set key from these chests.</p>
<h1 id="An-overview-of-D2-Lod-Gambling-What-can-and-cannot-be-gambled"><a href="#An-overview-of-D2-Lod-Gambling-What-can-and-cannot-be-gambled" class="headerlink" title="An overview of D2 Lod Gambling: What can and cannot be gambled"></a>An overview of D2 Lod Gambling: What can and cannot be gambled</h1><p>Gambling has long been a tradition in Diablo 2, with players betting all sorts of in-game items on duels and races. The gambling scene in Diablo 2 has only grown in popularity with the release of ladder season 6 and the subsequent introduction of the D2LOD Ladder.</p>
<p>The D2LOD Ladder is a special server that allows players to gamble their hard-earned items for a chance to win even better ones. While item gambling is not allowed on standard Diablo 2 servers, it is perfectly legal on the D2LOD Ladder. This has created a bustling economy where players can buy, sell, and trade items for large sums of money.</p>
<p>There are however some things that cannot be gambled on the D2LOD Ladder. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Items that have been duped or hacked.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Items that have been modified using third-party programs such as Item Hack or Rune Words Editor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Items that are part of an unbroken set (i.e., cannot be gambled separately).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Items with socketed gems that are worth more than 10 million gold pieces.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The study, carried out by a team of researchers at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, looked at the effects of so-called “Thai River Wonders” – natural surroundings that are believed to have healing properties, including rivers, caves, and mountains – on problem gamblers.</p>
<p>The study participants were divided into two groups – those who spent time in nature settings and those who did not. The results showed that those who spent time in nature had a significant reduction in gambling problems compared to those who did not.</p>
<p>The researchers believe that the positive effects observed may be due to the fact that natural surroundings help promote relaxation and calmness, which can help reduce stress and addictive impulses.</p>

It is the tenth longest river in the world and passes through six countries: Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and China.</p>
<p>For centuries, the Mekong River has been a vital transportation route and source of food for the people who live along its banks. But in recent years, the Mekong has also become a vital resource for hydroelectric power.</p>
<p>This has led to the construction of numerous dams and reservoirs along the river’s course. While these dams have provided much-needed electricity for growing economies, they have also had a devastating impact on the environment and on local communities.</p>
<p>The most dramatic example of this is the Xayaburi Dam in Laos. This dam was completed in 2012 and has had a devastating impact on the environment and on local communities. Fish stocks have declined dramatically and many villagers have been forced to relocate due to flooding caused by the dam.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, the Thai government has announced plans to build 10 new “mega-dams” on the Mekong River. These dams will not only provide much-needed hydroelectric power but they will also help to regulate water levels downstream and protect against flooding.</p>
<p>The first of these new dams – The Pak Beng Dam – is scheduled to be completed in 2021. Once complete, it will be able to generate up to 960 megawatts of power, making it one of the largest hydroelectric dams in Southeast Asia.</p>

        <h1 id="How-Does-the-IRS-Understand-You-Have-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#How-Does-the-IRS-Understand-You-Have-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How Does the IRS Understand You Have Gambling Winnings?"></a>How Does the IRS Understand You Have Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a specific process it follows to understand if gambling winnings are taxable and how much tax is owed on those winnings. The process can be complicated, but the IRS provides clear instructions to help taxpayers report their gambling income correctly.</p>
<p>The first step in understanding how gambling winnings are taxed is to know the definition of gambling income. Gambling income includes winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and casinos. It also includes cash and prizes won from poker tournaments, as well as any value of items won such as cars or vacations.</p>
<p>Gambling losses can also be deducted from gambling income, but only up to the amount of gambling income earned. This means that taxpayers cannot use losses to create a tax deduction larger than their gambling income for the year.</p>
<p>Once gambling income is determined, it is added to other income sources to calculate the taxpayer’s total annual income for the year. This total annual income is used to determine the tax bracket that taxpayer is in and what tax rate should be applied to the gambling income.</p>
<p>For example, if a taxpayer has $50,000 in total annual income and wins $2,000 from playing poker, then their gambling income would be subject to the 22% tax rate since that falls within their 22% tax bracket. However, if they had won $10,000 instead of $2,000 then the gambling income would be taxed at the 24% tax rate since that is the rate for taxpayers in the 24% tax bracket with total annual incomes between $82,501 and $157,500.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that not all of the gambling winnings will be subject to federal taxes. Winnings less than $5,000 are generally not subject to federal taxes unless they are from a professional gambler or Raffle tickets with a price of more than $600 per ticket. In these cases, part of the winnings may be subject to federal taxes and part may not, depending on how much of the ticket price was paid for with after-tax dollars.</p>
<p>  The IRS takes its responsibility in understanding and collecting taxes on gambling winnings very seriously. By following these simple steps taxpayers can ensure they report their winnings correctly and avoid any penalties from the IRS</p>
<h1 id="Condo-Your-gambling-winnings-and-save-money-on-your-taxes"><a href="#Condo-Your-gambling-winnings-and-save-money-on-your-taxes" class="headerlink" title="Condo Your gambling winnings and save money on your taxes"></a>Condo Your gambling winnings and save money on your taxes</h1><p>If you gamble, you may be able to deduct your losses on your taxes. But what about your winnings? The good news is that you don’t have to pay taxes on them—at least not right away.</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifies gambling winnings as “other income.” This means that you don’t have to report them on your tax return unless they total more than $5,000 in a year. In other words, the first $5,000 of your gambling winnings are tax-free.</p>
<p>But just because the winnings are tax-free doesn’t mean you can keep them all. You still have to pay income taxes on any money you withdraw from the winning pot. So if you hit a jackpot worth $10,000, for example, and take home $8,000 after taxes and other withholdings, you’ll owe income taxes on the entire $8,000.</p>
<p>Assuming you meet the $5,000 threshold, any gambling winnings beyond that amount are taxable. This includes casino jackpots, lottery prizes, and even betting profits. And if you happen to lose money while gambling, those losses can be used to offset your taxable gambling income.</p>
<p>There are a few other things to keep in mind when it comes to gambling income and taxes:</p>
<p>Gambling income is considered self-employment income . This means that you may have to pay both federal and state self-employment taxes on it.</p>
<p>. This means that you may have to pay both federal and state self-employment taxes on it. Winnings from bingo or slot machines are taxable regardless of whether they’re played at a casino or racetrack .</p>
<p>or slot machines are taxable regardless of whether they’re played at a or . Gambling winnings are also subject to income tax withholding . Casinos will often withhold 25% of your winnings for federal taxes, so make sure to account for that when budgeting for your big score.</p>
<p>So if you’re lucky at the casino or hit the jackpot playing the lottery, there’s no need to worry about paying taxes on your earnings right away. Just remember that any money you take out of the winning pot is subject to income taxes. And if you’re unlucky enough to have gambling losses during the year, those can help reduce your overall tax burden.</p>
<h1 id="Are-My-Gambling-Winnings-Taxable"><a href="#Are-My-Gambling-Winnings-Taxable" class="headerlink" title="Are My Gambling Winnings Taxable?"></a>Are My Gambling Winnings Taxable?</h1><p>When it comes to gambling winnings, there are often a lot of questions about what is taxable and what is not. The good news is that most gambling income is considered taxable, but there are some exceptions. This article will help you better understand the tax rules related to gambling income.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is that not all gambling income is taxable. Gambling income includes profits from games of chance, such as casino games, lotteries, and slot machines. It also includes profits from sports betting. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, gambling losses are not deductible on your taxes.</p>
<p>In general, any money or other value you receive as a result of gambling is considered taxable income. This includes cash prizes, winnings from bets or wagers, and the fair market value of any goods or services you receive as a result of gambling. If you receive less than $600 in gambling income during the year, you do not have to report it on your tax return.</p>
<p>If you have Prizes and awards that are not recreational in nature:</p>
<p>-You must include in gross income the amount of any prize or award that’s worth more than $5,000 if it’s related to your work (including if you win it in a contest or sweepstakes). You must include in gross income an amount equal to the excess of the FMV of the prize or award over the cost of purchasing it .</p>
<p>  So if I purchase a $4000 car for winning a contest unrelated to my work I must declare ($4000 - $5000) &#x3D; $1000 as additional taxable wages subject to normal payroll deductions</p>

But, if you do happen to lucky enough to win, it’s important to know what records to keep. </p>
<p>First and foremost, keep track of the money you won. This includes both the initial sum as well as any subsequent winnings. If possible, try to break this information down by gambling game or type so that you have a better understanding of which games are more profitable for you. </p>
<p>In addition, make note of the date and time of each win. This can help you determine how consistent your wins are and aide in future gambling planning. Finally, it’s also helpful to record the casino or venue where you won. This can come in handy if there are any disputes about your winnings down the road. </p>
<p>By taking these basic steps, you’ll be able to protect yourself in case something ever goes wrong with your gambling winnings. So, next time Lady Luck is on your side, make sure you’re prepared!</p>
<h1 id="How-the-IRS-Handles-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#How-the-IRS-Handles-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How the IRS Handles Gambling Winnings"></a>How the IRS Handles Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service oversees all gambling winnings in the United States. Whether you hit it big at the casino or won a small prize playing bingo, the IRS wants its cut. The good news is that most gambling income is considered taxable income, and there are a few ways to reduce your tax liability.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the basics: what types of gambling income are taxable? The answer is pretty much anything that comes from gambling. This includes winnings from casino games, lotteries, raffles, horse races, and even dice games. It also includes any prizes or awards you may receive from sweepstakes or contests.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some types of gambling income are not taxable. This includes losses from gambling activities, as well as any prizes or awards you may receive that are not related to gambling (such as a car you won in a raffle).</p>
<p>So how do you report your gambling income on your tax return? The answer depends on whether the income is from a hobby or a business. If it is from a hobby, you will report it on Schedule A as other miscellaneous deductions. If it is from a business, you will report it on Schedule C as self-employment income.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the income is from a hobby or a business, you will need to include Form W-2G if the amount of your winnings is more than $1,200. This form reports the total amount of your winnings and lists any federal taxes that were withheld from those winnings. You will also need to include this form if you received any Form 1099-MISC for gambling income.</p>
<p>The good news is that most gambling losses can be deducted on your tax return. In fact, you can deduct up to $3,000 of your losses each year. To claim these losses, you will need to itemize your deductions on Schedule A. Be sure to list the total amount of your losses on line 28 of Schedule A and attach Form 1040X to your return.</p>
<p>While there are certainly some rules and regulations surrounding gambling income, the good news is that most of it is considered taxable income. And if you have any questions about how to report this income on your tax return, be sure to consult with a qualified tax professional.</p>

        <h1 id="New-York-Officials-Say-No-to-Legal-Gambling"><a href="#New-York-Officials-Say-No-to-Legal-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New York Officials Say No to Legal Gambling"></a>New York Officials Say No to Legal Gambling</h1><p>According to a new report, officials in New York have decided that they do not want legal gambling in the state. The decision was made after a study was conducted on the potential effects of legalized gambling.</p>
<p>The study found that there could be a number of negative consequences if gambling was legalized, including an increase in problem gambling and crime rates. In addition, officials were concerned that legal gambling could cannibalize revenue from other industries in the state.</p>
<p>Legalized gambling is currently available in a number of states, including Nevada and New Jersey. However, it is not available in New York, which is one of the most populous states in the country.</p>
<p>Gambling is a controversial issue, and there are many who believe that it should be legalized. However, officials in New York seem to be taking the opposite position, at least for now.</p>
<h1 id="State-Leaders-Claim-It’s-Not-Worth-the-Trouble"><a href="#State-Leaders-Claim-It’s-Not-Worth-the-Trouble" class="headerlink" title="State Leaders Claim It’s Not Worth the Trouble"></a>State Leaders Claim It’s Not Worth the Trouble</h1><p>For years, state and local leaders have been advocating for a change in the federal tax code that would allow them to keep more of the money they earn. However, a recent report by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) has found that this change would do little to help stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>According to the report, the proposed change would result in an overall increase in federal revenue of only $846 million over 10 years. This amount is insignificant when compared to the trillions of dollars in federal revenue that would be generated by other proposed changes to the tax code.</p>
<p>In addition, the report found that the proposed change would provide very little relief to taxpayers in states with high income taxes. For example, taxpayers in California and New York would only see an average reduction in federal tax liability of $460 and $280, respectively.</p>
<p>Despite these findings, state and local leaders continue to push for the change. They argue that it is not worth giving up billions of dollars in revenue just to receive a fraction of that amount back in tax relief.</p>
<h1 id="They-Believe-It-Would-Cause-More-Problems-Than-It-Solves"><a href="#They-Believe-It-Would-Cause-More-Problems-Than-It-Solves" class="headerlink" title="They Believe It Would Cause More Problems Than It Solves"></a>They Believe It Would Cause More Problems Than It Solves</h1><p>The idea of a universal basic income (UBI) has been around for centuries, but it has been gaining more attention in recent years as a potential solution to the growing problem of inequality. Proponents of UBI argue that it would provide everyone with a basic income sufficient to live on, regardless of their employment status, and would thus eliminate poverty.</p>
<p>Critics of UBI argue that it would be too costly, and would not actually solve the problem of poverty. They believe that it would cause more problems than it solves, by discouraging people from seeking employment, and by causing inflation.</p>
<p>There is no clear evidence as to whether or not UBI would be effective in reducing poverty. However, there is reason to believe that it could be beneficial in some cases. In countries such as Finland and Canada, where UBI has been tested on a small scale, there have been positive results. People who received the UBI were more likely to find employment, and there was no increase in the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the question of whether or not UBI should be implemented on a larger scale is something that needs to be decided on a case-by-case basis. There are pros and cons to both sides of the argument, and it is important to weigh all the evidence before making a decision.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Has-Negative-Consequences-For-Society"><a href="#Gambling-Has-Negative-Consequences-For-Society" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Has Negative Consequences For Society"></a>Gambling Has Negative Consequences For Society</h1><p>Gambling is often seen as a bit of fun, with people using it as a way to pass the time or to make some easy money. However, what many people don’t realise is that gambling can have some very serious consequences for society as a whole.</p>
<p>For a start, gambling can lead to financial problems for those who get caught up in it. This can then lead to them borrowing money from loan sharks or other illegal sources in order to continue gambling, which can cause all sorts of other problems.</p>
<p>In addition, gambling can also be addictive, which can lead to people spending more and more money on it until they are unable to control their behaviour. This can then have a negative impact on their work and personal lives, as well as their relationships with friends and family.</p>
<p>Finally, gambling can also be linked to criminal activity. This includes things like theft and fraud in order to get money to gamble with, as well as more serious offences such as drug dealing and prostitution.</p>
<p>So overall, it is clear that gambling has a number of negative consequences for society. These consequences can be very damaging for individuals, families and communities alike, so it is important that we take steps to avoid them wherever possible.</p>
<h1 id="Officials-Are-Concerned-About-Its-Impact-on-Local-Communities"><a href="#Officials-Are-Concerned-About-Its-Impact-on-Local-Communities" class="headerlink" title="Officials Are Concerned About Its Impact on Local Communities"></a>Officials Are Concerned About Its Impact on Local Communities</h1><p>The Trump administration’s decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program is stirring up strong reactions from all sides. While some lawmakers and officials are voicing support for the president’s move, many others are concerned about the impact it could have on local communities.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that DACA was an “unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch.” He went on to say that the program was implemented unilaterally after Congress failed to pass legislation on the issue.</p>
<p>The decision to rescind DACA affects nearly 800,000 undocumented young people who were brought to the United States as children. These individuals are now at risk of being deported, as they will no longer be able to work or attend school legally.</p>
<p>Many local officials and community leaders have spoken out against the Trump administration’s decision, arguing that it will have a devastating impact on young people and their families. They say that these individuals have grown up in America and consider themselves Americans, and that deporting them would be a huge mistake.</p>
<p>In a statement, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said: “These are our friends and neighbors; they contribute to our economy and help make our cities stronger. Ripping them away from their homes and families is nothing less than heartless.”</p>
<p>Other mayors from major cities such as New York, Chicago, and San Francisco also issued statements condemning the president’s decision.</p>

        <h1 id="How-to-Calculate-the-Probability-of-Winning-in-Gambling"><a href="#How-to-Calculate-the-Probability-of-Winning-in-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How to Calculate the Probability of Winning in Gambling"></a>How to Calculate the Probability of Winning in Gambling</h1><p>Gambling may seem like a game of chance, but there are ways to calculate the probability of winning. In this article, we’ll walk through how to do that, and how to use those calculations to your advantage.</p>
<p>There are a few factors that go into calculating the probability of winning in gambling. The first is the odds of the bet. This is simply the ratio of what you stand to win compared to what you stand to lose. For example, if you bet $1 on a coin flip and you win, you would get $2 back (since you would have doubled your money). So the odds in this case would be 2:1, or 2&#x2F;1.</p>
<p>The second factor is the size of your bet. This will determine how much you can potentially win (or lose). So if you have a $10 bankroll and want to play blackjack, for example, your maximum bet would be $10.</p>
<p>The third factor is House Edge. This is simply the percentage of each bet that the casino keeps as profit. So in our previous example, with a 2:1 odds and a House Edge of 5%, the casino would keep 5% of every bet placed (and pay out 95% of it).</p>
<p>Now that we know all of these factors, we can start calculating the probability of winning. The first step is to figure out our chances of winning on any given bet. We can do this by multiplying together the odds and our chance of winning (which is always 1):<br>(Odds) * (Chance of Winning) &#x3D; (Probability)<br>So for our coin flip example, it would be:<br>2&#x2F;1 * 1 &#x3D; 2&#x2F;3 or 66.7% chance of winning.<br>We can do this for any type of bet by plugging in the numbers. For instance, let’s say we want to calculate the probability of hitting a royal flush in poker. The royal flush has an odds payout of 4000:1, so our calculation would look like this:<br>4000&#x2F;1 * 1 &#x3D; 4000&#x2F;4000 or 100% chance of hitting it!</p>
<p>Obviously, in reality things aren’t quite that simple since we’re not playing against perfect odds. But this calculation provides us with a good estimate for our chances of winning on any given bet.</p>
<p>Now that we know how to calculate probabilities, we can use them to our advantage by tailoring our bets according to which games have better odds for us. For instance, blackjack typically has better odds than roulette because roulette has more unfavorable betting options (like betting on red or black). So by choosing blackjack instead, we can increase our chances of winning overall.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no fool-proof strategy when gambling and even with careful planning there’s always some risk involved. But using these calculations as a guide can help improve your chances and give you a better shot at walking away with some extra cash!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Calculate-Odds-in-Gambling"><a href="#How-to-Calculate-Odds-in-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How to Calculate Odds in Gambling"></a>How to Calculate Odds in Gambling</h1><p>Gambling is all about making calculated risks and hoping for the best possible outcome. Just like with any other type of investment, if you want to be a successful gambler, you need to have a good understanding of the odds involved. This article will teach you how to calculate odds in gambling, so that you can make informed decisions about where to place your bets.</p>
<p>The first step in calculating odds is to understand the different types of wagers that are available. In general, there are three different types of wagers:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Fixed Odds - In a fixed odds wager, the payout is set ahead of time based on the probability of winning. For example, in a coin flip, the payout would be even money (1:1), since there is an equal chance of either side winning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Parlay - A parlay is a series of fixed odds wagers that are all placed together as one bet. If any one of the individual wagers within the parlay loses, then the entire parlay loses. The payout for a successful parlay is significantly higher than for a single bet, but the risk is also higher.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prop Bet - A prop bet is a special type of wager that is not based on the outcome of a particular game or event. Instead, it is based on the performance or stats of one or more players or teams. For example, you might bet on how many points LeBron James will score in tonight’s game. Prop bets offer a lot of variety and can be quite fun, but they also come with much higher odds than traditional bets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you understand the different types of wagers available, you can start calculating odds by assigning probabilities to each outcome. In most cases, this can be done very easily by using basic math skills. For instance, if there is a 50&#x2F;50 chance of something happening (such as flipping a coin), then the odds would be 1:1 (or even money). If there is only a 10% chance of something happening (such as picking an ace from a deck of cards), then the odds would be 10:1 (or 10 fold).</p>
<p>It’s important to note that in some cases, you may not be able to find an exact probability for certain outcomes. In these cases, you can use your best judgement to guesstimate what the probability might be. As long as your estimates are reasonable, they will still help you make accurate calculations.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to calculate odds in gambling, it’s time to put your skills into practice! Try out some different wagers and see how well you do. Make sure to keep track of your winnings and losses so that you can improve over time. With enough practice and patience, you may just become a gambling pro!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Calculate-House-Edge-in-Gambling"><a href="#How-to-Calculate-House-Edge-in-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How to Calculate House Edge in Gambling"></a>How to Calculate House Edge in Gambling</h1><p>Gambling is a form of entertainment that comes with risk. The thrill of winning or losing money is what attracts many people to gambling. To make things more exciting, casinos and other gambling establishments offer games with huge payouts.</p>
<p>However, these games are not always fair to the player. In some cases, the house edge can be quite high, making it almost impossible for players to win. if you want to gamble but don’t want to end up losing all your money, it’s important to understand how the house edge works and how to calculate it.</p>
<p>In general, the house edge is the percentage of each bet that the casino expects to keep over the long run. It’s calculated by dividing the casino’s expected profit by the amount of bets they expect to take in. For example, if a casino expects to earn $10 in profit from every $100 bet, their house edge would be 10%.</p>
<p>This percentage varies depending on the game being played. Blackjack, for example, typically has a lower house edge than slot machines. Roulette has one of the highest house edges of any casino game.</p>
<p>There are ways to reduce this percentage and give yourself a better chance of winning. One is to learn how to count cards in blackjack (an article for another day). Another is to use strategies designed specifically for particular games. For example, there are betting systems that can be used in roulette which can help you reduce the house edge.</p>
<p>Knowing the house edge is important whether you’re a beginner or experienced gambler. It helps you understand how likely you are to win or lose and allows you to make informed decisions about where and when to gamble.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Gambol-Smarter-A-guide-to-understanding-gambling-probabilities"><a href="#How-to-Gambol-Smarter-A-guide-to-understanding-gambling-probabilities" class="headerlink" title="How to Gambol Smarter: A guide to understanding gambling probabilities"></a>How to Gambol Smarter: A guide to understanding gambling probabilities</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but it can also be a way to lose money if you’re not careful. Understanding the odds of different games is key to maximizing your chances of winning and minimizing your losses.</p>
<p>In general, the odds of any game are determined by the probability of each possible outcome. For example, in a coin flip, there are two possible outcomes (heads or tails), so the odds of flipping heads are 50%. This means that if you flip a coin 10 times, you would expect 5 heads to appear.</p>
<p>Some games have more complex odds, which can make them more difficult to understand. Blackjack, for example, has different odds depending on what cards are drawn. In general, however, the odds favor the casino slightly, with a house edge of around 0.5%. This means that over time, the casino will earn an average profit of 0.5% on any money wagered.</p>
<p>Understanding gambling probabilities can help you make better decisions about when to bet and how much to bet. It can also help you avoid costly mistakes when playing games with high house edges. By knowing the chances of each outcome, you can make informed decisions about which games to play and how much money to risk.</p>

If you’re looking to improve your odds of winning, learning how to calculate possibilities is a good place to start. In this article, we’ll discuss the basics of calculating probabilities so that you can make informed decisions when gambling.</p>
<p>To calculate the probability of an event occurring, you need to know two things: the number of outcomes that could result in the event and the total number of outcomes possible. Let’s use an example to illustrate this point.</p>
<p>Suppose you are playing roulette and want to know the probability of landing on black. There are 38 outcomes that could result in landing on black (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 12, 13, 14, 15 16, 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38), and there are 38 possible outcomes in total (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184). This means that the probability of landing on black is 1&#x2F;38 or 2.6%.</p>
<p>Now let’s suppose you are playing poker and want to know the probability of being dealt a pair. There are 216 possible outcomes that could result in being dealt a pair (all of the combinations of two cards from a deck of 52 cards), and there are 52*51&#x2F;2 or 2,598 possible outcomes in total. This means that the probability of being dealt a pair is 4.3%.</p>
<p>As you can see, calculating probabilities can help you make better decisions when gambling. By understanding the odds for different events, you can make more informed choices about what bets to place and how much money to risk.</p>

        <h1 id="United-States-Becomes-Latest-Country-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#United-States-Becomes-Latest-Country-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="United States Becomes Latest Country to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>United States Becomes Latest Country to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>On October 16, 2018, the United States lifted a longstanding ban on online gambling, becoming the fourth country in the world to do so. The move was seen as a major victory for the casino industry, which has pushed for years for the legalization of online gambling.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling have long argued that it is addictive and can lead to financial ruin. But supporters say that it is a safe and convenient way to gamble, and that it can generate significant tax revenue for governments.</p>
<p>The legalization of online gambling in the United States has been a long time coming. Legislation to legalize it was first proposed in Congress back in 2006, but it was met with strong resistance from conservative lawmakers and religious groups.</p>
<p>It took until 2013 for a bill to be passed legalizing online poker, but it only applied to Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey. Other states were later allowed to join the consortium, but online casinos remained illegal nationwide.</p>
<p>That all changed in October 2018, when President Donald Trump signed into law the Restoration of America’s Wire Act (RAWA). RAWA overturned the previous bill and legalized online gambling nationwide. It also gave states the right to decide whether or not to allow casinos within their borders.</p>
<p>Casino operators were quick to capitalize on the news, with stocks surging on Wall Street following the announcement. MGM Resorts International saw its stock price jump by 6 percent, while Wynn Resorts saw an increase of 9 percent. Caesars Entertainment also saw its stock price go up by 5 percent.</p>
<p>The casino industry is expected to generate $41 billion in revenue from online gambling by 2023, according to market research firm H2 Gambling Capital. That’s up from $19 billion in 2018.</p>
<h1 id="New-Zealand-Moves-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#New-Zealand-Moves-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Zealand Moves to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>New Zealand Moves to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>On July 5, 2018, New Zealand lawmakers passed the Gambling Amendment Bill which effectively legalized online gambling in the country. The new law allows for both domestic and international operators to apply for licenses to offer online casino games, sports betting, and lotteries to Kiwi players.</p>
<p>The passing of the bill was welcomed by the casino industry, which has been pushing for legalization for some time. David Wang of SkyCity Entertainment Group said that the new law will provide a more level playing field for domestic operators and help attract overseas operators to invest in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Online gambling is already popular in New Zealand, with around NZ$200 million (US$145 million) wagered online each year. However, most of this is currently done through unlicensed offshore sites, which means players have no protection if something goes wrong. The new law will establish a licensing regime and set up a complaints process, giving players greater confidence when gambling online.</p>
<p>It is expected that the first licences will be issued in early 2019, with the first casinos going live later that year. In the meantime, the Department of Internal Affairs is working on regulations that will need to be introduced before licences can be issued. These include rules on age verification, safeguarding against money laundering and protecting players from addictive behaviour.</p>
<h1 id="Gibraltar-Continues-its-Status-as-a-European-Leader-in-Online-Gaming-Regulation"><a href="#Gibraltar-Continues-its-Status-as-a-European-Leader-in-Online-Gaming-Regulation" class="headerlink" title="Gibraltar Continues its Status as a European Leader in Online Gaming Regulation"></a>Gibraltar Continues its Status as a European Leader in Online Gaming Regulation</h1><p>Gibraltar, a self-governing British Overseas Territory, has become one of the world’s leading online gaming regulators. The jurisdiction was among the first in the world to develop a regulatory framework for the remote gambling industry, and it has been widely praised for its approach.</p>
<p>The Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association (GBGA), which represents Gibraltar-based online gaming companies, has called Gibraltar “the gold standard in online gaming regulation.” The GBGA points to the jurisdiction’s “strong and effective regulatory regime,” which it says is characterized by “a robust licensing process, extensive due diligence standards and an effective complaint and dispute resolution mechanism.”</p>
<p>Gibraltar’s success as a regulator is underscored by the fact that it has been able to attract some of the world’s leading online gaming companies. These include industry leaders such as William Hill, bwin.party, 888 Holdings, and Ladbrokes. In addition, Gibraltar is home to some of the largest online casinos in the world, including Spin Palace Casino, Ruby Fortune Casino, and All Slots Casino.</p>
<p>The benefits of Gibraltar’s regulatory regime have not gone unnoticed by other jurisdictions. In 2012, the Isle of Man signed an agreement with Gibraltar to cooperate on online gaming regulation. And in 2013, both Malta and Denmark began working with Gibraltar to develop their own online gaming regimes.</p>
<h1 id="Denmark-Officially-Announces-Plans-to-Legalize-and-Regulate-Online-Poker-and-Casino-Games"><a href="#Denmark-Officially-Announces-Plans-to-Legalize-and-Regulate-Online-Poker-and-Casino-Games" class="headerlink" title="Denmark Officially Announces Plans to Legalize and Regulate Online Poker and Casino Games"></a>Denmark Officially Announces Plans to Legalize and Regulate Online Poker and Casino Games</h1><p>This week, Denmark’s Minister for Taxation Karsten Lauritzen officially announced the government’s plans to legalize and regulate online poker and casino games in the country. The news was welcomed by the Danish gambling industry, which has been pushing for such a move for years.</p>
<p>The proposal includes a number of measures to protect consumers and ensure the integrity of the gambling market. For example, licensed operators will be required to verify the identity of players before they can start playing, and there will be a cap on how much players can lose in any given day. In addition, there will be limits on the number of licenses that will be issued, in order to prevent any one company from becoming too dominant.</p>
<p>The government is expecting that legalization will generate around DKK 500 million (USD 78 million) in tax revenue annually. This is a significant amount, but it’s still just a fraction of the total gambling revenue generated in Denmark each year. Online gambling currently accounts for around DKK 2.5 billion (USD 396 million) in annual revenue, so there is still plenty of room for growth.</p>
<p>There is no set timeline for when online poker and casino games will become legal in Denmark, but we should see some movement on this front in the coming months. In the meantime, interested players can already start playing at some of the licensed offshore sites that are currently available.</p>
<h1 id="Sweden-Moves-Closer-to-Ratifying-Legislation-that-would-Legalize-Online-Gaming"><a href="#Sweden-Moves-Closer-to-Ratifying-Legislation-that-would-Legalize-Online-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Sweden Moves Closer to Ratifying Legislation that would Legalize Online Gaming"></a>Sweden Moves Closer to Ratifying Legislation that would Legalize Online Gaming</h1><p>The Swedish Parliament has unanimously approved a bill that would legalize online gaming in the country. The new legislation now heads to the Swedish Riksdag for a final vote, which is expected to take place before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Sweden has been mulling over the legalization of online gaming for some time now, and the move is seen as a way to help protect consumers and generate tax revenue. The new legislation would allow for licensed operators to offer casino games, poker, and other types of gambling to Swedish players.</p>
<p>Online gaming is currently available in Sweden, but it is not regulated. This has resulted in a number of unlicensed operators offering their services to Swedish players. The new legislation would create a legal and regulated environment for online gaming, which would help protect players from shady operators.</p>
<p>In addition, the new legislation would generate significant tax revenue for Sweden. It is estimated that the new regulations could bring in as much as SEK 2 billion (USD 235 million) in taxes each year. This would be a welcome addition to Sweden’s budget, which has been hit hard by recent economic challenges.</p>
<p>It is still unclear whether or not the Swedish Riksdag will approve the new legislation. However, there is strong support for it among lawmakers, and it seems likely that it will be passed in some form. If so, Sweden will become the latest country to legalize online gaming.</p>

<p>The Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016 was passed in the Senate by 36 votes to 18 and will now head to the House of Representatives, where it is also expected to be approved.</p>
<p>Once the bill becomes law, bookmakers will be able to offer their services to Australian customers, including live betting, while casinos will be able to offer casino games such as blackjack and roulette. However, poker will not be available for legal wagers.</p>
<p>The government has said that the new laws are needed in order to protect consumers from rogue operators and to ensure that gambling is conducted in a safe and responsible manner.</p>
<p>Bookmakers operating in Australia must already abide by strict regulations, including being licensed by state or territory authorities. The new legislation will further increase regulation of the industry and introduce fines of up to A$1 million for companies that offer unlicensed gambling services.</p>
<p>Australian Wagering Association (AWA) CEO Peter Coleman welcomed the news, saying that it would provide a more level playing field for the industry.</p>
<p>“This is an important day for our industry and marks a turning point for online wagering in Australia,” Coleman said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We commend the government for its efforts in developing this reform package which provides a more level playing field for all participants, better protects consumers and safeguards vulnerable people.”</p>

<li><p>The Netherlands has become the latest country to rule that online poker is a game of skill, paving the way for its legalization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The decision by the Court of Appeals in The Hague follows similar rulings in countries such as Canada, Spain and New Zealand, all of which have concluded that poker is not a game of chance and therefore does not contravene their respective gambling laws.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In making its ruling, the Dutch court cited evidence from experts who testified that successful poker players are able to make informed decisions based on their understanding of the game, the players around them and the cards they are holding.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This latest development is likely to be welcomed by poker players in New Zealand, who up until now have been unable to enjoy playing their favourite games online safely in the knowledge that it is legal and regulated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It also represents another step forward for online gambling in Spain, which has finally legalized online poker and other casino games after years of discussion and debate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, it means that Canadian players can now enjoy a wide range of online gambling activities without breaking the law, including casino games, sports betting and even horse racing.</p>
