#  Professional athletes urge fans to avoid gambling

A number of professional athletes are urging their fans to avoid gambling, saying that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin.

In a video campaign dubbed "Don't Bet on It," NBA stars Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and James Harden warn about the dangers of gambling.

"Gambling can be very addictive and can take over your life pretty quickly," Curry says in the video. "It can cause financial problems, legal problems, and worst of all, it can cost you relationships with the people you care about most."

Harden adds, "Gambling definitely is not worth it. It's nothing but headaches and heartaches."

The campaign is funded by the American Gaming Association, which represents the casino industry. The association has been fighting efforts to expand legalized sports betting beyond Nevada.

Professional athletes have long been wary of gambling, dating back to the Black Sox Scandal of 1919 in which several members of the Chicago White Sox were accused of throwing the World Series after taking bribes from gamblers.

#  Athletes warn of the dangers of gambling

In the world of professional sports, gambling is often spoken about in hushed tones. Athletes and team owners routinely admonish their players against placing any type of bet on sporting events, arguing that it is a surefire way to ruin careers.

While there are certainly dangers associated with gambling, many athletes argue that it can also be a source of excitement and entertainment. They maintain that as long as bets are placed responsibly and players don't allow themselves to be drawn into unhealthy betting habits, gambling can be an enjoyable diversion.

Despite these arguments, most professional sports leagues take a dim view of gambling and do everything they can to discourage players from engaging in it. This is due in part to the fact that there have been a number of high-profile cases in which athletes have lost large sums of money as a result of their gambling activities.

One such case involved former NBA player Michael Jordan, who reportedly lost millions of dollars by betting on basketball games. In addition, several current and former NFL players have been suspended from the league for violating its gambling policy.

Clearly, gambling can be harmful if not done correctly. However, with responsible betting and adherence to league rules, there is no reason why it can't be a fun activity for athletes and fans alike.

#  Pro athletes want fans to steer clear of gambling

One might think that professional athletes would be all for anything that fans do to support their team, but apparently, some pros are asking people to steer clear of gambling when it comes to sports.

Athletes like LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant have spoken out recently about the dangers of gambling and how it can negatively affect not just the game, but also the players themselves.

Durant was especially vocal on the issue, saying that he doesn’t want fans to “gamble on our games.”

“It’s such a touchy topic because it is entertainment, but we don’t want anyone affecting the game in a negative way because they’re betting on it and things like that,” said Durant.

James echoed Durant’s sentiment, noting that while he understands that gambling is a part of sports fandom for some people, it can still be harmful.

In fact, research has shown that a significant number of people who gamble on sports do so in order to make money – something that can have a very dangerous impact on the games themselves.

Curry pointed out that there are already enough ways for people to make money through sports without having to bet on them, and he doesn’t want fans to put their hard-earned money at risk by gambling on games.

Ultimately, it seems as though professional athletes just want their fans to enjoy the games in a safe and responsible way – and that definitely doesn’t include gambling on them.

#  Players urge fans not to gamble on sports

As the excitement of the World Cup builds, players are urging fans not to gamble on the games.

Speaking at a press conference in Moscow, several players said that betting can ruin careers and friendships.

“We want to urge all fans not to bet on the World Cup,” German midfielder Toni Kroos said. “It can ruin lives and careers. It’s not worth it.”

Kroos was joined by Brazilian defender Thiago Silva, who said, “Gambling can cause huge problems – it can even lead to divorce. So please don’t do it!”

In England, midfielder Dele Alli echoed those sentiments. “Don’t bet on the World Cup – it can ruin your life. I’ve seen it happen to people close to me and it’s not nice. So don’t do it!”

Alli is no stranger to gambling controversies himself; he was fined £25,000 by The Football Association in February for appearing in an advertising campaign for a bookmaker last year.

Players have good reason to be concerned about the dangers of gambling: In March, FIFA imposed a six-year ban on Slovenian player Andraz Struna for gambling on his own national team matches. In addition, former England international Paul Gascoigne has been blighted by gambling problems throughout his career.

So far during the World Cup, there have been no reports of any players being banned for gambling on the tournament; however, with billions of dollars at stake, there is plenty of potential for corruption.

While some countries have introduced laws banning gambling on sports events, many fans continue to bet illegally. According to a study by UK-based Betting Watchdog last year, 97% of people in Britain who gamble on sport do so illegally.

With so much money at stake, it is unlikely that fans will stop betting on this year’s World Cup anytime soon. However, players would prefer that fans don’t put their financial future or personal relationships at risk by wagering on the games.

#  Sports figures speak out against gambling

In the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision to repeal the federal ban on sports betting, many professional athletes have spoken out against gambling.

NFL quarterback Cam Newton said, “I think it’s bad for our society. Gambling is based on greed. It’s not good for people in our society.”

NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley added, “I love gambling, but I hate gaming. There’s a big difference. Gambling is when you go to casinos and stuff like that. Gaming is when you sit in your house and play video games all day long… I think it’s a terrible idea. I don’t think people should be able to gamble on sports… I just don’t think it’s a good thing for our country.”

Gambling has long been a controversial issue, with many arguing that it can have negative consequences for both individuals and society as a whole. Professional athletes have often been some of the most vocal opponents of gambling, and their voices are likely to be amplified in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision.
