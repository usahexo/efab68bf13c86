#  AsVEL Looks to Expand Sports Betting Operation Throughout Illinois 

Regionally based AsVEL Corporation is looking to expand its sports betting operation to additional sites throughout Illinois. The company has indicated that it plans to open a total of five new locations in the coming weeks, pending licensing approval from the state lottery.

AsVEL currently operates three brick-and-mortar sportsbooks in downstate Illinois: Carbondale, Marion, and Mt. Vernon. With the legalization and expansion of sports wagering in Illinois, the company decided to move forward with an aggressive expansion strategy. Reports suggest that AsVEL is eyeing sites in Chicago, Aurora, Joliet, Rockford, and Champaign-Urbana for its next wave of locations.

The success of New Jersey’s online sports betting market has been a major driver in this decision. New Jersey’s online market generated over $330 million in revenue during its first year of operation, with over $100 million being generated in December 2018 alone. This demonstrates that there is significant demand for legalized sports betting outside of Nevada and Atlantic City.

Illinois is expected to generate significant revenue from legalized sports betting as well. A recent study by gaming analytics firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming estimated that Illinois could generate up to $1.2 billion in annual gaming revenue from sports wagering alone. This would make Illinois one of the largest gambling markets in the country.

AsVEL CEO Prakash Hariharan touted the potential benefits of legalized sports betting for the state of Illinois, stating that it would create jobs and provide much-needed revenue for important state programs:

"Legalized sports betting will create jobs throughout the state and provide much-needed revenue for important state programs," said Prakash Hariharan, CEO of AsVEL Corporation."We are excited about our plans to expand our operations into additional cities across Illinois and look forward to offering our customers a safe and enjoyable experience when they bet on their favorite teams."

With extensive experience in both brick-and-mortar and online gaming operations, AsVEL is well positioned to take advantage of this growing industry. The company looks poised to become one of the leading players in the rapidly expanding Illinois sports betting market.

#  Sports Bettors Can Now Place Their Bets on AsVEL Games 

Bettors can now place their bets on AsVEL games after the sports betting company, Betway, partnered with the French club. 

AsVEL is a basketball team that is based in Villeurbanne, a suburb of Lyon, France. The team was founded in 2001 and currently competes in the LNB Pro A, the top-tier French professional basketball league.

“We are really happy to have teamed up with Betway as our official betting partner,” said AsVEL President Tony Parker. “This partnership is important for our club as it will allow us to develop our international visibility and attract new fans around the world.” 

Tony Parker is a French professional basketball player who has played for the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is also one of the co-owners of AsVEL. 

The agreement between Betway and AsVEL will see Betway become the “official global betting partner” of the team. This means that Betway will have exclusive rights to offer betting markets on all of AsVEL’s games, including pre-match and live betting markets. 

"Asvel are an exciting team to watch and we're proud to be partnering with them,” said Betway Director of Trading Adam Savinson. “We look forward to providing our customers with great value odds on all their matches across La Liga and LNB Pro A." 

French bettors will now be able to bet on their national league as well as international fixtures featuring AsVEL. And English-speaking bettors will be able to bet on many other top European basketball leagues such as Spain's Liga ACB and Italy's Serie A through Betway's website.

#  Illinois Residents Can Now Bet on AsVEL Games 

The Illinois Gaming Board has granted a license to AsVEL, a professional basketball team, which will allow residents of the state to place bets on its games. This is the first time that a professional sports team in the U.S. has been given this type of license.

“It’s great news for the franchise and for our fans, who will now be able to place legal wagers on our games,” said AsVEL president Jean-Luc Rouge.

Bettors will be able to place bets at casino sportsbooks and online sports betting sites. The minimum bet is $2, and the maximum bet is $500.

AsVEL competes in the French Basketball League, which is considered to be one of the best leagues in Europe. The team is headquartered in Lyon, France, and has won six league championships since it was founded in 2000. AsVEL also won the 2016-17 Eurocup championship.

The team’s most high-profile player is Anthony Randolph, who has played in the NBA and represented Team USA in international competition. Other notable players on the team include Edwin Jackson (a two-time Euroleague champion) and Louis Labeyrie (a former member of the French national team).
