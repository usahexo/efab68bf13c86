#  How well do they protect devices?

The best way to keep your devices safe is by using a good quality case. Not all cases are created equal, so you need to do your research to find the best one for your needs.

There are a few things you should look for when choosing a case. The first is how well it protects your device. It should cover all of the edges and have good-quality padding to absorb shocks.

The second thing to consider is how easily you can use the device with the case on. Some cases make it difficult to access all of the ports and buttons, which can be frustrating. Look for one that has cutouts for all of the ports and buttons, as well as easy access to the camera and microphone.

Another important factor is how durable the case is. It should be able to withstand drops, bumps, and scratches without breaking or looking worn out.

Finally, consider your budget when selecting a case. Cases range in price from a few dollars to several hundred dollars, so choose one that fits your budget but still provides adequate protection for your devices.

Here are some of the best cases available on the market today:

1) Otterbox Defender Series Case for iPhone X ($49.95) - This case is designed to protect against drops, bumps, scratches, and dust invasion. The Otterbox Defender Series Case has three layers of protection: an outer shell, a built-in screen protector, and a silicone slipcover.

2) Speck Presidio Grip Case for iPhone X ($39.95) - This case has a hard outer shell and soft inner lining to protect against drops, bumps, and scratches.

3) Griffin Survivor Extreme-Duty Case for iPad Pro ($99.99) - This iPad Pro case is designed for those who are hard on their devices.

#  Are they really free?

The words free and liberty are often used interchangeably, but they have different meanings. The word free means that something is not prohibited and liberty means the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants.

Both libertarians and liberals claim to support freedom and liberty. But there is a big difference between the two ideologies. Libertarians believe in economic freedom while liberals believe in social freedom.

Economic freedom is the ability to produce, trade, and consume what you want without government intervention. Social freedom is the ability to have any lifestyle you choose as long as it doesn’t hurt others.

Most people think that libertarians are for little or no government control, but that’s not always the case. Libertarians believe in limited government where the government only protects our rights from others. They don’t believe in using violence to achieve their goals like socialists and communists do.

Liberals believe in using violence to achieve their goals of social justice. This often results in trampling on the rights of others. For example, liberals want the government to control healthcare and education. This would force everyone to pay for services they may not want or need. It would also limit our choices and lower the quality of healthcare and education.

Libertarians also oppose gun control laws because they believe that it violates our right to bear arms. Liberals support gun control because they think it will make society safer. But statistics show that gun control laws actually make society less safe because they disarm law-abiding citizens while criminals continue to use guns illegally.

So are libertarians really for freedom and liberty or are they just pretending? The answer is both yes and no. Libertarians support economic freedom while liberals support social freedom, which leads to trampling on the rights of others.

#  How often do they need to be updated?

There is no absolute answer to this question as it depends on various factors, such as the age of your estate plan, the value of your estate and how complicated it is. However, most experts recommend reviewing your estate plan at least every five years. This will ensure that it still reflects your current wishes and that all required updates have been made.

If there have been significant changes in your life or in the laws since you drew up your estate plan, then you will likely need to update it sooner. For example, if you get divorced, have a child or make a significant change to your financial situation, you should revisit your estate plan immediately.

 likewise, if there have been any changes to state or federal estate tax laws since you created your plan, you'll need to update it to reflect those changes. Generally speaking, though, keeping your estate plan up-to-date is a good idea regardless of whether any major changes have occurred in your life.

# What should be included in an updated estate plan?

There are a number of things that should be updated when you update your estate plan. First and foremost, you'll want to make sure that the executor or trustees named in your plan are still up for the task. If someone has passed away or is no longer able or willing to serve in that role, you'll need to name new individuals.

You'll also want to review the beneficiaries named in your will or trust and make sure they still reflect your wishes. If someone has passed away or if you'd like to change who receives what portion of your estate, you'll need to update those designations. Additionally, if any of your assets have changed in value since you created your plan, you may need to revise the distribution percentages accordingly.

Other things that may need to be updated include POAs (power of attorneys), healthcare proxies and living wills. It's important to review each document closely and make any necessary changes so that they still reflect your wishes and preferences.
