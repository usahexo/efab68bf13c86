#  xqc to play Hearthstone in upcoming tournament

A big announcement in the world of competitive Hearthstone this week: XQC, of Dallas Fuel fame, has been accepted to play in the next Innkeeper‚Äôs Invitational.

This tournament is a follow-up to one hosted by Blizzard back in April, which was won by Andrey ‚ÄúReynad‚Äù Yanyuk. The new tournament will be casted by popular Hearthstone personalities Trump and Kripparian, and will also feature ThijsNL, Hafu, and others.
