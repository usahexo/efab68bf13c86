#  Australians can now legally bet on sports and play casino games online!

Australians will now be able to legally bet on sports and play casino games online after the country’s parliament passed new legislation on Tuesday.

The Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016 was passed in the Senate by 36 votes to 18 and will now head to the House of Representatives, where it is also expected to be approved.

Once the bill becomes law, bookmakers will be able to offer their services to Australian customers, including live betting, while casinos will be able to offer casino games such as blackjack and roulette. However, poker will not be available for legal wagers.

The government has said that the new laws are needed in order to protect consumers from rogue operators and to ensure that gambling is conducted in a safe and responsible manner.

Bookmakers operating in Australia must already abide by strict regulations, including being licensed by state or territory authorities. The new legislation will further increase regulation of the industry and introduce fines of up to A$1 million for companies that offer unlicensed gambling services.

Australian Wagering Association (AWA) CEO Peter Coleman welcomed the news, saying that it would provide a more level playing field for the industry.

“This is an important day for our industry and marks a turning point for online wagering in Australia,” Coleman said in a statement.

“We commend the government for its efforts in developing this reform package which provides a more level playing field for all participants, better protects consumers and safeguards vulnerable people.”

1. The Netherlands has become the latest country to rule that online poker is a game of skill, paving the way for its legalization.

2. The decision by the Court of Appeals in The Hague follows similar rulings in countries such as Canada, Spain and New Zealand, all of which have concluded that poker is not a game of chance and therefore does not contravene their respective gambling laws.

3. In making its ruling, the Dutch court cited evidence from experts who testified that successful poker players are able to make informed decisions based on their understanding of the game, the players around them and the cards they are holding.

4. This latest development is likely to be welcomed by poker players in New Zealand, who up until now have been unable to enjoy playing their favourite games online safely in the knowledge that it is legal and regulated.

5. It also represents another step forward for online gambling in Spain, which has finally legalized online poker and other casino games after years of discussion and debate.

6. Finally, it means that Canadian players can now enjoy a wide range of online gambling activities without breaking the law, including casino games, sports betting and even horse racing.
