#  Who Owns Blackjack Pasta Balzac?

In the Province of Quebec, there is a small town called Balzac. It is here, in this charming town, where you will find Blackjack Pasta Balzac. This quaint little restaurant is well known for its delicious pasta dishes. But who owns it?

The answer to that question is a little complicated. The restaurant was originally founded by two sisters, Sylvie and France Beaudoin. However, the sisters eventually sold the business to their nephew, Nicolas Thivierge.

So, while Nicolas Thivierge technically owns the restaurant, the sisters are still very involved in its day-to-day operations. They continue to play a major role in creating new recipes and menu items. And they also take care of all of the marketing and promotional activities.

This family-owned business has been a huge success thanks to its amazing food and warm atmosphere. In fact, Blackjack Pasta Balzac was recently named one of the best Italian restaurants in Quebec!

#  Pasta Maker Sues Blackjack for Infringement

The makers of the popular pasta maker, Pastamaker, have filed a lawsuit against casino game Blackjack, alleging that the game infringes on their patented design.

Pastamaker's attorneys issued a statement claiming that "the design of Blackjack is substantially similar to our patented design, and we believe that consumers are being misled into thinking that Blackjack is affiliated with our product."

In response, representatives from Blackjack denied any wrongdoing, stating that the game has been in existence for centuries and is not in any way related to the pasta maker.

"This lawsuit is frivolous and simply a ploy to try and make some money off of an old game," said one representative from the casino game. "We intend to fight this case tooth and nail."

The outcome of the case is still undecided, but it will be sure to generate a lot of buzz in the legal community.

#  Blackjack Sells Pasta Maker to Cryovac for $182 Million

Dealers at the [[Blackjack]] casino in Las Vegas were busy Wednesday as they packed up the last of the pasta makers and shipped them off to Cryovac. The casino has agreed to sell its pasta maker division for $182 million.

The sale is part of a larger effort by Blackjack to focus on its core gambling business. The company has been struggling in recent years as online gambling has taken off, and it is looking to divest itself of non-essential businesses.

''This was a difficult decision, but it is the right one for our company,'' said Blackjack CEO Jerry Auburn in a statement. ''We are focusing on our core strengths and this move will allow us to do that.''

Cryovac is a subsidiary of Sealed Air Corporation, a packaging company with over $7 billion in revenue. It is not clear what the company plans to do with the Blackjack pasta makers, but officials say they are excited about the acquisition.

''This is a great opportunity for us,'' said Cryovac CEO William Hickey in a statement. ''The Blackjack pasta maker division is a well-respected brand with a long history of quality products.''

The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.
