#  Poker Hands that will Shock You on TV Game Show

If you're like most people, you probably think that the hands shown on televised poker games are nothing like the hands that you see at your friendly neighborhood game. You may be surprised to find out that some of the hands shown on TV are actually more common than you think.

One of the most shocking hands that you'll see on a poker game show is one where all of the players fold preflop. This can happen for a number of reasons, but it's generally safe to say that folding is the best option when no one has anything worth betting on.

Another surprising hand is one in which a player loses with a full house or four of a kind. While these hands are certainly powerful, they can also be very risky if your opponents have anything resembling a good hand. It's always important to remember that even the best hand can be beaten in poker, so make sure to play cautiously and make smart decisions.

Finally, one of the most shocking hands in poker is the all-in bluff. This is a hand in which a player bets everything they have on what is essentially a coin flip. While this hand can be very successful, it's also very risky and should only be attempted if you're absolutely sure that your opponent doesn't have anything better.
