#  New York Officials Say No to Legal Gambling

According to a new report, officials in New York have decided that they do not want legal gambling in the state. The decision was made after a study was conducted on the potential effects of legalized gambling.

The study found that there could be a number of negative consequences if gambling was legalized, including an increase in problem gambling and crime rates. In addition, officials were concerned that legal gambling could cannibalize revenue from other industries in the state.

Legalized gambling is currently available in a number of states, including Nevada and New Jersey. However, it is not available in New York, which is one of the most populous states in the country.

Gambling is a controversial issue, and there are many who believe that it should be legalized. However, officials in New York seem to be taking the opposite position, at least for now.

#  State Leaders Claim It’s Not Worth the Trouble

For years, state and local leaders have been advocating for a change in the federal tax code that would allow them to keep more of the money they earn. However, a recent report by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) has found that this change would do little to help stimulate the economy.

According to the report, the proposed change would result in an overall increase in federal revenue of only $846 million over 10 years. This amount is insignificant when compared to the trillions of dollars in federal revenue that would be generated by other proposed changes to the tax code.

In addition, the report found that the proposed change would provide very little relief to taxpayers in states with high income taxes. For example, taxpayers in California and New York would only see an average reduction in federal tax liability of $460 and $280, respectively.

Despite these findings, state and local leaders continue to push for the change. They argue that it is not worth giving up billions of dollars in revenue just to receive a fraction of that amount back in tax relief.

#  They Believe It Would Cause More Problems Than It Solves

The idea of a universal basic income (UBI) has been around for centuries, but it has been gaining more attention in recent years as a potential solution to the growing problem of inequality. Proponents of UBI argue that it would provide everyone with a basic income sufficient to live on, regardless of their employment status, and would thus eliminate poverty.

Critics of UBI argue that it would be too costly, and would not actually solve the problem of poverty. They believe that it would cause more problems than it solves, by discouraging people from seeking employment, and by causing inflation.

There is no clear evidence as to whether or not UBI would be effective in reducing poverty. However, there is reason to believe that it could be beneficial in some cases. In countries such as Finland and Canada, where UBI has been tested on a small scale, there have been positive results. People who received the UBI were more likely to find employment, and there was no increase in the rate of inflation.

Ultimately, the question of whether or not UBI should be implemented on a larger scale is something that needs to be decided on a case-by-case basis. There are pros and cons to both sides of the argument, and it is important to weigh all the evidence before making a decision.

#  Gambling Has Negative Consequences For Society

Gambling is often seen as a bit of fun, with people using it as a way to pass the time or to make some easy money. However, what many people don’t realise is that gambling can have some very serious consequences for society as a whole.

For a start, gambling can lead to financial problems for those who get caught up in it. This can then lead to them borrowing money from loan sharks or other illegal sources in order to continue gambling, which can cause all sorts of other problems.

In addition, gambling can also be addictive, which can lead to people spending more and more money on it until they are unable to control their behaviour. This can then have a negative impact on their work and personal lives, as well as their relationships with friends and family.

Finally, gambling can also be linked to criminal activity. This includes things like theft and fraud in order to get money to gamble with, as well as more serious offences such as drug dealing and prostitution.

So overall, it is clear that gambling has a number of negative consequences for society. These consequences can be very damaging for individuals, families and communities alike, so it is important that we take steps to avoid them wherever possible.

#  Officials Are Concerned About Its Impact on Local Communities

The Trump administration’s decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program is stirring up strong reactions from all sides. While some lawmakers and officials are voicing support for the president’s move, many others are concerned about the impact it could have on local communities.

In a statement released on Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that DACA was an “unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch.” He went on to say that the program was implemented unilaterally after Congress failed to pass legislation on the issue.

The decision to rescind DACA affects nearly 800,000 undocumented young people who were brought to the United States as children. These individuals are now at risk of being deported, as they will no longer be able to work or attend school legally.

Many local officials and community leaders have spoken out against the Trump administration’s decision, arguing that it will have a devastating impact on young people and their families. They say that these individuals have grown up in America and consider themselves Americans, and that deporting them would be a huge mistake.

In a statement, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said: “These are our friends and neighbors; they contribute to our economy and help make our cities stronger. Ripping them away from their homes and families is nothing less than heartless.”

Other mayors from major cities such as New York, Chicago, and San Francisco also issued statements condemning the president’s decision.
