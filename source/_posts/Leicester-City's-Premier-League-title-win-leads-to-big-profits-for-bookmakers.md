#  Leicester City's Premier League title win leads to big profits for bookmakers

Just over a year ago, Leicester City began their Premier League campaign as 5,000/1 outsiders to lift the title. Fast forward to the end of the season and they had defied all odds, becoming the undisputed champions of English football in one of the most astonishing stories in sporting history.

This stunning success led to big profits for bookmakers, who had taken large sums of money from punters expecting Leicester to finish near the bottom of the table. In total, bookmakers around the world are thought to have made £25 million from Leicester’s title win, with some firms recording profits in excess of £10 million.

Leicester’s success was also good news for online casinos and other gambling platforms, which benefitted from a surge in betting activity leading up to and during the season. The biggest winner was Coral, which saw its share price increase by 30% following Leicester’s championship win.

So how did Leicester defy all odds to win the Premier League? There are many factors that contributed to their success, including hard work, team spirit and a bit of luck. But perhaps the most important factor was their manager Claudio Ranieri, who instilled a never-say-die attitude in his players and got the best out of them on a limited budget.

It is no exaggeration to say that Ranieri is one of the greatest managers in football history, and his achievements with Leicester will go down in history. He has now won titles in four different countries (Italy, England, Spain and France), which is a record that may never be surpassed.

Leicester’s title triumph has also reignited interest in the Premier League around the world. In countries like Thailand and China – where football is not traditionally popular – fans are now beginning to see the appeal of English football and are tuning in to watch games live or on television. This can only be good news for the Premier League, as it expands its global reach and attracts new fans from all corners of the globe.

In summary, Leicester City’s Premier League title win has been a huge financial windfall for bookmakers around the world. It has also helped to increase interest in English football in countries where it was not previously popular, and could pave the way for further growth and global expansion for the Premier League.

#  Leicester City's underdog story provides major boost to online betting companies

The online betting industry is experiencing a surge in business activity thanks to Leicester City’s astounding performance in the English Premier League. The Foxes are currently leading the pack and are considered the clear underdogs, having started the season at 5000-1 odds to win the Premier League.

This has not only generated a lot of excitement among fans of the game, but it has also resulted in a major boost for online bookmakers. In fact, one betting company is reporting that its turnover has increased by over 400% since the start of the season.

It is not surprising that Leicester City’s Cinderella story has captured the imaginations of so many people. After all, it is a rare occurrence for an underdog to come out on top, and this is precisely what makes sports betting so exciting. There is always the chance that an underdog could pull off an upset and bring home the trophy.

Online bookmakers have been cashing in on this by offering increasingly generous odds on Leicester City winning the Premier League. In some cases, you can even get odds of 100-1 or higher on them pulling off an upset victory.

This is great news for punters, who now have a much better chance of making a profit if they place a bet on Leicester City. And with so much money at stake, it is no surprise that online bookmakers are doing everything they can to capitalise on this opportunity.

Leicester City has been having an amazing season. At one point they were 5000 to 1 odds to win the Premier League. With only a few games left in the season, people are betting record numbers on them. Some bookmakers have stopped accepting bets because it’s too risky, but that isn’t stopping people from betting anyways. even if they don’t win the title, their popularity is only going to continue to grow.

#  Bookmakers enjoy bumper profits as Leicester City defy all odds to win the Premier League

Ever since Leicester City were confirmed as Premier League champions, the bookmakers have been counting the profits they have made. The odds of Leicester City winning the Premier League at the beginning of the season were 5000-1, and so bookmakers have raked in a fortune as a result of their unexpected success.

It is not just Leicester City who have benefited from the bookmakers’ generosity – all of the teams who finished in the bottom half of the table also made healthy profits. This is because punters invariably backed those teams to be relegated, and so when they survived, the bookmakers had to payout large sums of money.

In fact, one bookmaker has admitted that they paid out more than £1 million in winnings on Leicester City alone. This is a staggering figure when you consider that the team only cost £1 million to buy at the beginning of the season.

The bookmakers are not the only ones who have made a fortune out of Leicester City’s success – Ranieri and his players will also share in a £100 million windfall. This is because they will receive a payment based on their final league position, with the champions set to earn around £5 million each.

This is a remarkable turnaround for a team which was almost relegated last season, and it proves that anything is possible in football.
